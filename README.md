# World_Weather_Analysis
In this module we used Google Api data to fomulate or show destination information for travel, and then created itineraries based on that data.In using this data we were able to create possible destinations for good vacation spots. This also provided data such as weather and ideal hotels that can be viewed in the area.

## Overview 
To create the vacation map, we created a random list of 1500 coordinantes. Using the Map API we were able to find the number of cities in the local area of those coordinates and create ana anvenure for customers to view and pick a destionation that seemed desirable to them. How they did this was by viewing a map that was created by our porgram that was using data about that area which we obtained with the API.
